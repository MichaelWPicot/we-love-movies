## Description
The goal of this project was to create a RESTful API by writing and using installed middleware. This API includes CRUD routes in an Express server which perform database queries to access and display data related to movies, theaters, and reviews. This API is connected to a UI built in React styled with Bootstrap.

This project primarily uses Express.js, Knex.js, Cors, and PostgreSQL.

This api has been [deployed](https://we-love-movies-api.onrender.com/). The home URL does not display data but [/movies](https://we-love-movies-api.onrender.com/movies) and [/theatres](https://we-love-movies-api.onrender.com/theatres) have data available through .get requets. [/reviews](https://we-love-movies-api.onrender.com/reviews) does not respond to get requests but does respond to .put and .delete commands.

The front-end for this API has been [deployed](https://we-love-movies-4yum.onrender.com/). Please check the following [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MichaelWPicot/we-love-movies-frontend) for more information.
